        <h1>Extra Notes</h1>

        <p>- Your browser might block the file because it is "suspicous".
            Just click on "download anyway". I assure you this downlaod
            is completely safe, and it is okay to download.</p>

        <p>- You can move the file "speed_racer" to your desktop for easier
            access by dragging it from downloads onto the desktop. This only
            works on Mac.</p>

        <p>- It will take a bit to load, I can't do anything about this so
        just be patient it <i>will</i> open.</p>
